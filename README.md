Running tests using Jest, node.js and applying CI with CircleCI

English

To run the test just "npm run test" or "yarn test".

This will runs the tests in sum.test.js which is testing the function sum located in sum.js.

You can protect the branch with circleCI, so each commit has to pass all the tests before being uploaded. To do this go to the project in GitHub -> Settings -> Branches -> Set the rules to protect the branches 

Spanish
